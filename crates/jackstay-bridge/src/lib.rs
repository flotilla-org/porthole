//! Cross-host bridge for Jackstay publications.
//!
//! A bridge is a translator peer (porthole ADR-0008): the *egress half* is an
//! ordinary Jackstay consumer on host A that encodes what it acquires and sends
//! it over a link; the *ingress half* is an ordinary Jackstay producer on host B
//! that decodes what arrives and republishes it as a new local publication.
//! Neither half is a coordinator; whoever spawned them hands each a grant.
//!
//! The link is two byte streams, media and control, carried by whatever the
//! coordinator forwarded (a Unix socket pair on one host, an SSH stream-local
//! forward between hosts). The framing in [`wire`] is carrier-agnostic and the
//! same message set is meant to ride QUIC streams or Media over QUIC groups
//! later without change.
