//! The native handle path (ADR-0004): frames are OS-native surfaces published
//! by reference, never by copying pixels.
//!
//! A native frame in the broadcast ring is just a descriptor: `(pool_id,
//! slot_id)` names a surface in a pool that was introduced over the setup
//! channel, and `fence_value` is the point on the stream's timeline fence the
//! consumer must wait for before sampling. Handles and fds never enter ring
//! slots. [`NativeFrameBackend`] is the platform seam behind that contract;
//! the macOS IOSurface/MTLSharedEvent implementation arrives in a later slice
//! (#84), and [`fake`] provides an OS-free implementation for tests.
//!
//! Surface reuse is *prevented*, not detected: the neutral core excludes
//! slots still named by live ring entries, then asks the backend/reuse policy
//! to claim one of the remaining candidates. macOS can answer with IOSurface
//! in-use state; Linux answers with explicit lease/release state and native
//! release synchronization.
