## Problem

`porthole launch --app /Applications/WezTerm.app` fails with `launch_correlation_failed` even though the window opens, is owned by a known PID, and is straightforwardly findable via `porthole search`. The current correlation strategy (env-var tag injection, surfaced via `ps eww`) doesn't see WezTerm's window because the window-owning process either doesn't carry the launch env or is reached via macOS XPC plumbing rather than a direct fork.

This pattern is the rule, not the exception, for terminals: WezTerm, kitty, iTerm2 (`single_instance` mode), and Terminal.app all have either multi-process architectures or LaunchServices-mediated activation that breaks naive env-var inheritance assumptions. The kitty-graphics-protocol harness (the immediate use case for porthole) lives or dies on launching arbitrary terminals reliably.

The current workarounds — `--require-confidence weak` and "launch externally then `attach`" — both work but neither is a sane default. An agent author should not need to know that "terminal" is a special case.

## Current strategy

`crates/porthole-adapter-macos/src/launch.rs::launch_process`:

1. Generate a random tag (e.g. `plt_a3f8c1...`).
2. Spawn the app with `PORTHOLE_LAUNCH_TAG=<tag>` in its environment via `NSWorkspace.openApplication` (or direct `Command::spawn` for non-bundle paths).
3. Loop until the launch deadline:
   - Enumerate windows via `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`.
   - For each window's `owner_pid`, run `ps eww -o command= -p <pid>` and look for `PORTHOLE_LAUNCH_TAG=<tag>` in the printed env block.
4. First match wins → `Confidence::Strong`, `Correlation::Tag`. No match by deadline → `launch_correlation_failed`.

The tag-injection plumbing is fine. The "find a window whose PID owns this env var" step is what breaks for apps where the window's PID is not the spawned PID's direct line.

## Design options considered

### A. PID-descendant correlation
After spawn, get the launched root PID. Walk descendant PID tree (`proc_listpids` / `proc_pidinfo` filtered by `PROC_PIDLISTCHILDREN`). Filter `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` by `owner_pid ∈ descendants`. Unique match → strong; multiple → ambiguous; none → fail.

- **Works for**: terminals that fork the shell as a child, any normally-launched GUI app where the window-owning process is the launched PID itself, multi-process terminals where the worker PID is a descendant of the launcher.
- **Breaks on**: terminals where the worker is a *sibling* of the launched PID (rare on macOS — the macOS process model is hierarchical), or where the window appears before the descendant tree settles (race).

### B. NSWorkspace PID + window watch
`NSWorkspace.openApplication` returns an `NSRunningApplication` with an authoritative `processIdentifier`. Watch CGWindowList for new windows whose `owner_pid == that PID`.

- **Pros**: zero PID-tree gymnastics.
- **Cons**: doesn't help WezTerm specifically. The launcher PID is the stub; the window owner is the long-lived worker. Strategy reduces to "exact PID match" which fails for the same reason as the tag strategy fails — neither sees the worker.

This is a strict subset of (A) for most cases and a broken case for terminals. Drop.

### C. AX `AXWindowCreatedNotification` observer
Subscribe via `AXObserver` for the launched PID. React to the notification with the new window's `AXUIElement`, extract `kAXWindowAttribute` chain, attach surface_id.

- **Pros**: authoritative — the OS itself signals the new window. No CGWindow polling, no PID-tree walking.
- **Cons**: requires AX permission (we have it), needs CFRunLoop integration in our tokio runtime (solvable but non-trivial), has subscribe-after-window-created races, and the notification target is the *application* — the window owner. Same problem as (B): for WezTerm, subscribing to the launched PID's AX observer doesn't see windows created by the worker process.

Could be combined with (A): subscribe to the AX observer of *every descendant PID* as we discover them. Heavier plumbing, marginal improvement over polling CGWindowList. Defer.

### D. Tag injection (current)
Existing strategy. Works for apps that surface env vars in AX or whose window-owning PID has the env in its `ps eww` output. Specifically broken for terminals.

## Chosen design

Layered fallback within a single launch attempt, ordered by signal quality:

1. **Tag injection (D)** runs first. Cheap, fast for apps that surface the tag. If a window with the tag is found within `tag_deadline_ms` (initial budget: 1500ms; tunable via spec field on `ProcessLaunchSpec`), return early with `Confidence::Strong`, `Correlation::Tag`.

2. **PID-descendant fallback (A)** kicks in if (1) hasn't matched by `tag_deadline_ms`. Compute the descendant PID set (recursive `proc_listpids(PROC_PIDLISTCHILDREN, ...)`) of the spawned root PID. Filter the current `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` snapshot by `owner_pid ∈ descendants`:
   - Exactly one window-owning descendant PID with at least one window → `Confidence::Strong`, `Correlation::PidDescendant`.
   - Multiple descendant PIDs each owning windows → `Confidence::Plausible`, `Correlation::PidDescendant`, with the candidate list returned in the launch outcome (same shape as the existing ambiguous case). The caller can pick via `attach`.
   - Zero matches → keep waiting until the launch timeout, then `launch_correlation_failed` (current behaviour).

3. **`--require-confidence` continues to gate** the failure threshold:
   - `strong` (default) — accept tag match OR single descendant match. Reject multiple-descendant ambiguity.
   - `plausible` — also accept multiple-descendant ambiguity (returns the strongest candidate; caller can re-attach to a different one if wrong).
   - `weak` — accept anything CGWindow lists with descendant ownership, even if multiple. Returns the topmost.

This gives terminals a reliable default path without requiring agent authors to know the WezTerm-specific quirk. `--require-confidence weak` stops being a workaround for "the tag isn't there" and goes back to its intended meaning of "I'll take any reasonable match."

## New types and wire shape

### `Correlation` enum gains `PidDescendant`
Currently:
```rust
pub enum Correlation {
    Tag,
    AxDocumentUrl,
    AxDocumentPath,
    Frontmost,
}
```
Add `PidDescendant`. Wire serialisation `pid_descendant` (snake_case to match existing variants).

### `ProcessLaunchSpec` gains `tag_deadline_ms: Option<u64>`
Default `1500` if `None`. Lower for fast-path apps (tag-only callers); higher to be patient with slow-launching ones. **Clamped to `timeout_ms` inside `launch_process`** — not at the caller — so callers can't bypass the bound by passing a larger value than the overall launch budget.

### Per-window descendant lookup helper
`crates/porthole-adapter-macos/src/correlation.rs::descendant_pids(root: u32, root_started_at: u64) -> Result<HashSet<u32>, PortholeError>`. Recursive `proc_listpids` until convergence. Bounded depth (16) to avoid pathological PID-cycle tar pits (which shouldn't exist but cheap to guard).

The `root_started_at` parameter is captured at spawn time via `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDT_SHORTBSDINFO)` (the `pbsi_start_tvsec` field). Before recursing on the root, the helper re-fetches the start time and bails with `launch_correlation_failed` if it doesn't match — that catches the rare PID-reuse case where the spawned process has died and the kernel has handed its PID to an unrelated process whose own descendants would otherwise pollute the match set.

### `--require-confidence weak` tiebreaker
When multiple windows match (multi-PID descendants each owning windows, OR one PID owning multiple windows), `weak` returns the topmost. "Topmost" is defined as **lowest `kCGWindowLayer` value** (closer to the user); ties broken by **lowest `kCGWindowNumber`** (CG assigns window numbers monotonically; lowest = oldest stack member still alive). One canonical tiebreaker, applied consistently regardless of whether the ambiguity is multi-PID or multi-window-of-one-PID — replaces the earlier wording that mentioned `kCGWindowMemoryUsage` for the single-PID case (inconsistent and less deterministic).

## Edge cases

### Apps that already had a window before we launched
LaunchServices may activate an existing window instead of creating a new one. Today this is detected via `surface_was_preexisting` based on the tag's absence in any newly-spawned process. With descendant correlation:

- If the matched window's `owner_pid` is *not* a descendant of our spawned root (because the spawn didn't happen — LaunchServices reused), we should not claim the match. The descendant-set membership check naturally rejects pre-existing windows.
- If the user passed `require_fresh_surface: true` and we get zero descendants with windows after the deadline, the launch fails with `launch_correlation_failed` — same as today.

### Multi-window apps
Some apps (Finder, Preview, browsers) spawn multiple windows on launch. The descendant set may have one PID owning multiple windows. With `--require-confidence strong`, this fails with `launch_correlation_ambiguous` and a candidate list — caller picks. With `--require-confidence weak`, the topmost-z-order tiebreaker described above resolves it deterministically.

(NSWorkspace's `frontmostApplication` cross-reference is *not* used — frontmost-at-launch-time isn't meaningfully related to "which window did we just create.")

### PID reuse
macOS PIDs cycle slowly (the kernel walks the PID table and skips live ones), but the cycle exists. If our spawned root PID dies and the kernel hands its number to an unrelated new process before correlation runs, that new process's descendants would otherwise pollute the match set.

Mitigation: the `descendant_pids` helper takes `root_started_at` (captured at spawn time) and re-fetches it before recursing; if the start time doesn't match the current PID's start time, the spawned process is gone and we bail with `launch_correlation_failed`. Cheap (one `proc_pidinfo` call), bounded (no retries — if PID reuse happened, the launch is irrecoverable for this attempt).

### Fork-then-exit launchers
Some apps (older `open` shims, third-party launchers) `fork` to do the real launch and the parent exits. The "spawned root PID" is gone before correlation runs.

Mitigation: the descendant set computation should treat a missing root PID as "use the most-recently-spawned process group" — fall back to the launcher's PID lineage via `getpgid`. If even that fails, `launch_correlation_failed` is the right answer; the caller should `attach` instead.

For v0: if the spawned PID is gone within the tag deadline, don't run descendant correlation; emit `launch_correlation_failed` with a hint in the error details. Better fallback heuristics are follow-up work.

### `require_fresh_surface: true` interaction
The descendant-set check naturally satisfies "fresh surface" — a window owned by a non-descendant PID can't be a fresh launch we made. No special-case needed.

## Implementation outline

Single PR, atomic commits:

1. **`feat(adapter-macos): descendant_pids helper + correlation::Correlation::PidDescendant`** — new pure FFI helper using `proc_listpids` (libproc). Add the `Correlation::PidDescendant` variant with serde rename, update wire `Correlation` mirror in protocol crate. Unit tests against a mocked `proc_listpids` (hand-rolled fake).

2. **`feat(adapter-macos): wire PID-descendant fallback into launch_process`** — add the layered fallback after the tag-injection deadline. Honor `tag_deadline_ms` from `ProcessLaunchSpec` (defaulting to 1500ms). Return the new `Correlation` in the `LaunchOutcome`. Per-confidence-level acceptance/rejection logic.

3. **`docs(recipes): drop the WezTerm workaround notes`** — update `docs/recipes/terminal-orchestration.md` and `scripts/manual-terminal-smoke.sh` to assume default `--require-confidence strong` works for any terminal.

## Test plan

- **Unit (in-memory)**: scriptable correlation outcomes — `InMemoryAdapter::set_next_descendant_pids(pids)` returning the descendant set; route the launch through the same correlation logic; assert per-confidence-level acceptance.
- **Unit (real FFI, ignored by default)**: `proc_listpids` against `std::process::id()` finds at least the current process. Smoke check; not a real-world coverage test.
- **Manual on real hardware**: `porthole launch --app /Applications/WezTerm.app` with default flags succeeds and returns a usable `surface_id`. Repeat for Ghostty, kitty, iTerm2, Terminal.app. The kitty-harness recipe runs end-to-end without `--require-confidence weak`.

## Out of scope

- AX `AXWindowCreatedNotification` observer (strategy C). Heavier plumbing; the descendant fallback should cover the kitty-harness use case. Revisit if real-world testing surfaces correlation flakiness this design doesn't fix.
- LaunchServices "reuse existing window" handling beyond the `surface_was_preexisting` flag. That's a deeper rework of the launch flow; this PR scopes to "broaden what counts as a fresh match."
- Cross-platform: Hyprland/X11/Wayland correlation strategies are different problems entirely. This spec is macOS-specific.
